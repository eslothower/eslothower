- 👋 Hi, I’m Eli Slothower (Ee-lie Slot-how-er). I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Computer Science, planning to concentrate in Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematical Sciences. Thanks for checking out my GitHub!
- 📚 I’m interested in mathematics, Python, Swift, Java, Apple, fighting for social justice, learning about different cultures, spreading diversity, battling prejudice, and working towards a solution to the climate crisis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a Teaching Assistant for 80-101, Dangerous Ideas in Science and Society, at Carnegie Mellon University. Here we explore some of the most challenging and controversial questions that arise from the intersection of science, technology, and society. This course thrives on educational debate and strives to make everyone question their own foundational beliefs. 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will make the world a better place and fights towards the better future of tomorrow.
